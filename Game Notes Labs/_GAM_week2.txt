World coordinate system: Every vector written in world
Local coordinate system: Every vector is written based on object

Transformation:
-Scale
-Rotate
-Translate

Homogeneous transform matrix

Libraries for matrix math:
-GLM, What we use
-VGL, Stuck if chosen

GLSL: Pipeline between VRAM and GPU
-Contains 5 shader options

1. Vertex operations: multiply every coordinate by the homogeneous matrix
2. Primitive assembly: Connect all the verticies
3. Calling fraston: Disregard all invisible verticies
4. Projection: convert to 2d
5. Coloring:
