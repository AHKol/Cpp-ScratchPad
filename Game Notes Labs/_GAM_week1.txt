Path:
Basics of 3D graphics
Intro 3d programming, C++
OpenGL
Game Engine

Game:
Game Design: Story, appearance, controls, (deliverables)
Game Content Creator: Use 3d modeling software to create animations/models
Game Programing: Code behavior of objects in game

The game engine is a tool to aid the Game Programing aspect. (Unity Unreal)

Tools for us:
Visual Studio C++
3D Graphics (OpenGL/DirectX) We use OpenGL
Understanding of 3D

3D graphics

You have 3d Model
->
MATHS!
->
2d projection

Why Graphics Improved:
Hardware ->
Software 1.2 -> 4.8
1992:
Fixed Pipeline(old) -> programming pipeline (modern)

Textures are overlaid onto the polygon

Veracities are sent to GPU then pushed to monitor

Structure of a openGL program
-Event driven program

Display()
//drawing
keyboard()
//handles events from keyboard
mouse()
//handles events from mouse
XXX()
//

Need to use these function names, openGL looks for them to function. 
Can rename through the glutDisplayFunc(my__display); function
