Bianary numbers represent
	Instruction
	addressing mode
	arguments
	
Instruction varys from cpu to cpu

ARMv8			Cortex A-53
	AArch64			In order of writen code
	AArch32		Cortex A-57
					Can change order of instruction for better speed\
				Also: A-72, -73, -75, -32, -35

write(1,"Hi"2); 				//write to standard output 2 character Hi
syscall(__NR_write,1,"Hi"2); 	//well operating system to write Hi

==Assembly==
.global _start	//dont throw out
.rodata			//place in read only memory

as -g -o hello.o hello.s 	//to assemble

.data
msg ascii "loop : ___"
//take register with index, add 48
//place in memory after loop string
//lenght is string + loop
