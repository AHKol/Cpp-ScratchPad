Break wave down to fractons(sample rate) 44.1/44.4 K signed 16-bit integer
Uncompressed: 2 bytes x 44.1k/sec x 2
128kbps standard commpression

Colour is pixed of 8*8*8 bit RGB
24bit colour 16million, higher in more intense situations

64bit machine
CPU requests memory address from machine, receve a word (64bits) and extract relevant data
If larger than word, CPU must perform 4 operations to make data useable
==Therefor alighn data in memory for speed==

I/O is a position in memory and changes based on imput, contain connection called interupts

Inside CPU
registers: Stores Value, Program counter, General purpous register, Status Register
Fetch: Retreve data
Decode: Understand data and instruct processing
Processing: Uses ISA, Instruction Set Architecture.

Architecture information, Width 32,64. Registers, how much temporary memory

==LAB==

4 Stages of compile
1. Preprocessing: Add 800 lines of function deffinitons, type DEFs, caused by #include 
2. Compilation, convert to assembly, close to machine code.
3. Assembly, turn assemply to machine code
4. Linking, connecting libraries to current.

Standard function is inside GNU Public library
Dynamically linked application will get function from individual libraries at runtime
Statically linked the whole function is added to the code
